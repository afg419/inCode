Interpreters a la Carte (Advent of Code 2017 Duet)

This post is just a fun one exploring a wide range of techniques that I applied
to solve the Day 18 puzzles of this year’s great [Advent of
Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017). The puzzles involved interpreting an
assembly language on an abstract machine. The neat twist is that Part 1 gave you
a description of one abstract machine, and Part 2 gave you a *different*
abstract machine to interpret the same language in. This twist (one language,
but different interpreters/abstract machines) is basically one of the textbook
applications of the *interpreter pattern* in Haskell and functional programming,
so it was fun to implement my solution in that pattern – the assembly language
source was “compiled” to an abstract data type once, and the difference between
Part 1 and Part 2 was just a different choice of interpreter.

Even more interesting is that the two machines are only “half different” –
there’s one aspect of the virtual machines that are the same between the two
parts, and aspect that is different. This means that we can apply the “data
types a la carte” technique in order to mix and match isolated components of
virtual machine interpreters, and re-use code whenever possible in assembling
our interpreters for our different machines!

This blog post will not necessarily be a focused tutorial on this trick, but
rather an explanation on my solution centered around this pattern, hopefully
providing insight on how I approach and solve non-trivial Haskell problems.
Along the way we’ll also use mtl typeclasses and classy lenses.

The Puzzle
----------

The puzzle is [Advent of Code 2017 Day 18](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18),
and Part 1 is:

> You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply
> “Duet”. Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code

> You suppose each register should start with a value of `0`.

> -   `snd X` *plays a sound* with a frequency equal to the value of `X`.
> -   `set X Y` *sets* register `X` to the value of `Y`.
> -   `add X Y` *increases* register `X` by the value of `Y`.
> -   `mul X Y` sets register `X` to the result of *multiplying* the value
>     contained in register `X` by the value of `Y`.
> -   `mod X Y` sets register `X` to the *remainder* of dividing the value
>     contained in register `X` by the value of `Y` (that is, it sets `X` to the
>     result of `X` modulo `Y`).
> -   `rcv X` *recovers* the frequency of the last sound played, but only when
>     the value of `X` is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)
> -   `jgz X Y` *jumps* with an offset of the value of `Y`, but only if the
>     value of `X` is *greater than zero*. (An offset of `2` skips the next
>     instruction, an offset of `-1` jumps to the previous instruction, and so
>     on.)
>
> Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter) or a

> number is that number.
>
> After each *jump* instruction, the program continues with the instruction to
> which the *jump* jumped. After any other instruction, the program continues
> with the next instruction. Continuing (or jumping) off either end of the
> program terminates it.
>
> *What is the value of the recovered frequency* (the value of the most recently
> played sound) the *first* time a `rcv` instruction is executed with a non-zero
> value?

Part 2, however, says:

Note that in each of these, “the program” is a program (written in the Duet
assembly language), which is different for each user and given to us by the
site.

What’s going on here is that both parts execute the same program in two
different virtual machines – one has “sound” and “recover”, and the other has
“send” and “receive”. We are supposed to run the same program in *both* of these
machines.

However, note that these two machines aren’t *completely* different – they both
have the ability to manipulate memory and read/shift program data. So really ,
we want to be able to create a “modular” spec and implementation of these
machines, so that we may re-use this memory manipulation aspect when
constructing our machine, without duplicating any code.

Parsing Duet
------------

First, let’s get the parsing of the actual input program out of the way. We’ll
be parsing a program into a list of “ops” that we will read as our program.

Our program will be interpreted as a list of `Op` values, a data type
representing opcodes. There are four categories: “snd”, “rcv”, “jgz”, and the
binary mathematical operations:

``` {.haskell}
type Addr = Either Char Int

data Op = OSnd Addr
        | ORcv Char
        | OJgz Addr Addr
        | OBin (Int -> Int -> Int) Char Addr
```

It’s important to remember that “snd”, “jgz”, and the binary operations can all
take either numbers or other registers.

Now, parsing a single `Op` is just a matter of pattern matching on `words`:

``` {.haskell}
parseOp :: String -> Op
parseOp inp = case words inp of
    "snd":c    :_   -> OSnd (addr c)
    "set":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (const id) x (addr y)
    "add":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (+)        x (addr y)
    "mul":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin (*)        x (addr y)
    "mod":(x:_):y:_ -> OBin mod        x (addr y)
    "rcv":(x:_):_   -> ORcv x
    "jgz":x    :y:_ -> OJgz (addr x) (addr y)
    _               -> error "Bad parse"
  where
    addr :: String -> Addr
    addr [c] | isAlpha c = Left c
    addr str = Right (read str)
```

We’re going to store our program in a `PointedList` from the
*[pointedlist](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointedlist)* package, which
is a non-empty list with a “focus” at a given index, which we use to represent
the program counter/program head/current instruction. Parsing our program is
then just parsing each line in the program string, and collecting them into a
`PointedList`. We’re ready to go!

``` {.haskell}
parse :: String -> P.PointedList Op
parse = fromJust . P.fromList . map parseOp . lines
```
