I've written about a variety of topics on this blog, but one thing I haven't
touched in too much detail is the topic of lenses and optics. A big part of this
is because there are already so many great resources on lenses, like the famous
(and my favorite) [lenses over tea](https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-1) series.

This post won't be a "lens tutorial", but rather a dive into a (what I believe
is an) insightful perspective on lenses and prisms that I've heard repeated many
times, but not yet all gathered together into a single place. In particular, I'm
going to talk about the perspective of lenses and prisms as embodying the
essences of products and sums (respectively), and how that observation can help
you with a more "practical" understanding of lenses and prisms.
