Welcome back! This article is part 3 of our journey through the *singleton
design pattern*, and the great
*[singletons](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons)* library!

This post will be a continuation of [Part
1](https://blog.jle.im/entry/introduction-to-singletons-1.html) and [Part
2](https://blog.jle.im/entry/introduction-to-singletons-2.html), so if you
haven't read those first, now would be a good time to pause and do so and also
work on some of the exercises. Today we will be expanding on the ideas in those
posts by working with more complex ways to restrict functions based on types.
Like the previous posts, we will start by writing things "by hand", and then
jumping into the singletons library and seeing how the framework gives you tools
to work with these ideas in a smoother way.

Code in this post is built on *GHC 8.4.3* with the
*[lts-12.9](https://www.stackage.org/lts-12.9)* snapshot (so, singletons-2.4.1).

Review
------

In the first post we looked at the `Door` type, indexed with a phantom type of
kind `DoorState`.

``` {.haskell}
$(singletons [d|
  data DoorState = Opened | Closed | Locked
    deriving (Show, Eq)
  |])

data Door :: DoorState -> Type where
    UnsafeMkDoor :: { doorMaterial :: String } -> Door s
```

This gives us (at least) three distinct types `Door 'Opened`, `Door 'Closed`,
and `Door 'Locked`, which can be used to represent opened, closed, and locked
doors, respectively. We talked in previous posts about how we can use this for
for a lot of enat tings, including enforcing type-safety, talking about how
inputs relate to outputs, and uniting functions polymorphic on all door states.

Then we talked about situations where we want to "not care" about the door
status in the type system, or when we want to return a door with a state that is
not known statically, and must be determined dynamically at runtime. After going
through many "analogous" and equivalent type, we arrived at the existential
wrapper `SomeDoor`:

``` {.haskell}
data SomeDoor :: Type where
    MkSomeDoor :: Sing s -> Door s -> SomeDoor
```

``` {.haskell}
mkSomeDoor :: DoorState -> String -> SomeDoor
mkSomeDoor ds mat = withSomeSing ds $ \dsSing ->
    MkSomeDoor dsSing mat
```

(We must be careful to pack the `Sing s` with the `Door s`, so that we can
pattern match at runtime to determine what the original `s` was.)

Finally, we talked a bit about the "unified" singleton system that the
*singleton* library offers. This included things like `SingI` to implicitly pass
singletons, and the `SingKind` kind-class that associates types with their
lifted kinds and lets you reify and reflect with functions like `withSomeSing`
and `fromSing`.

More Expressive Restrictions
----------------------------

Let's write a function that "knocks" on a door in IO:

``` {.haskell}
knock :: Door s -> IO ()
knock d = putStrLn $ "Knock knock on " ++ doorMaterial d ++ " door!"
```

Hm. This doesn't feel right. We can't knock on an opened door..can we? We could
try enforcing this by writing:

``` {.haskell}
knockClosed :: Door 'Closed -> IO ()
knockClosed d = putStrLn $ "Knock knock on " ++ doorMaterial d ++ " door!"

knockLocked :: Door 'Locked -> IO ()
knockLocked d = putStrLn $ "Knock knock on " ++ doorMaterial d ++ " door!"
```

But, that means that the user must pick between one of two functions to open
their door. This isn't quite what we wanted...we want the function to work only
for closed or locked doors, and not opened doors. We want to restrict how our
functions can be called.

There are a couple of ways of doing this --- we're going to look at two possible
ways involving singletons and the *singletons* library. Both of these methods
allow us to write dependently typed functions that are "type-safe" in more
expressive ways than before.

### Dependently Typed Proofs

One way to do this is with a dependently-typed "proof" that an operation is
legal. *Proofs* (in the dependently typed/constructivist/Curry-Howard sense) are
witnesses to some type-level predicate or proposition.

A **value-level predicate** in Haskell is (generally) a function of type
`a -> Bool`. Given a value of type `a`, if the function returns `True`, then the
predicate is satisfied. If it returns `False`, it is not.

A **type-level predicate** is (generally) a type constructor of kind
`k -> Type`. Given a type of kind `k`, if *a value exists of that type* (or, if
a value can be constructed), then the predicate is satisfied. If no value
exists, it is not. That value, if it exists, is called a *witness* or a
*proof*.[^1]

We can define a predicate `Knockable :: DoorState -> Type` as a GADT that only
has values if given `'Closed` and `'Locked`, but not `'Opened`:

``` {.haskell}
data Knockable :: DoorState -> Type where
    KnockClosed :: Knockable 'Closed
    KnockLocked :: Knockable 'Locked
```

Now, we have a value of type `Knockable 'Closed` and `Knockable 'Locked`
(`KnockClosed` and `KnockLocked`, respectively), but no value of type
`Knockable 'Opened`. How can we use this?

Well, we can make a version of `knock` that requires a proof that `s` is
`Knockable`:

``` {.haskell}
knock :: Knockable s -> Door s -> IO ()
knock _ d = putStrLn $ "Knock knock on " ++ doorMaterial d ++ " door!"
```

`knock` can now only be called with `Closed` and `Locked` doors --- do you see
why? There is no way to call `knock` with `s ~ 'Opened`...because there is no
way to pass a value of `Knockable 'Opened`. No such value exists! There's no
compiler error because it's "not even wrong"!

This works well if we want to do things at compile-time

``` {.haskell}
ghci> knock KnockClosed (UnsafeMkDoor @'Closed "Birch")
Knock knock on Birch door!
```

#### Let the compiler prove it for you

We can even make it more seamless to use by auto-generating proofs at
compile-time, with a general class like `Auto`:

``` {.haskell}
class Provable p a where
    auto :: p a

instance Provable Knockable 'Closed where
    auto = KnockClosed

instance Provable Knockable 'Locked where
    auto = KnockLocked
```

``` {.haskell}
ghci> knock auto (UnsafeMkDoor @'Closed "Acacia")
Knock knock on Acacia door!

ghci> knock auto (UnsafeMkDoor @'Opened "Jungle")
COMPILER ERROR!! COMPILER ERROR!!
```

Such a typeclass exists in libraries like
*[type-combinators](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-combinators)*
(called `Known`), and in dependently typed languages like Idris, `auto` is
actually a built-in language keyword that does this automatically!

#### Decidable Predicates

However, all of this only works if you know what `s` is at compile-time. What if
you don't? What if you are retrieving `s` at runtime (like from a `SomeDoor` or
`withSomeSing`), or you are forced to handle all possible `s`s?

To do this, we're going to take advantage of a property of some predicates
called "decidability". We say that a predicate is *decidable* if, for any input
type, we can say whether or not the predicate is satisfiable.

We say that a predicate `p` in Haskell is decidable if we can write:

``` {.haskell}
decidePred
    :: Sing a               -- ^ given a type
    -> Decision (p a)       -- ^ return a decision
```

Where:

``` {.haskell}
data Decision a = Proved a                  -- ^ a value of a exists
                | Disproved (Refuted a)     -- ^ a value of a cannot exist

-- | The data type with no values
data Void

-- | 'a' cannot exist.  Commonly also called `Not`
type Refuted a = a -> Void
```

`Decision a` is like a `Maybe a`, except instead of `Nothing`, we include a
proof that the predicate is *not* true.

For those unfamiliar with the `a -> Void` idiom (often called `Not a`, or
`Refuted a`), `a -> Void` is a type we use in Haskell to represent the fact that
it is impossible to construct a value of type `a`. That's because if you could,
then you could give it to an `a -> Void` to get a value of type `Void`, which is
impossible to have.

It's a lot to handle all at once, so let's look at an example. Is `Knockable` a
decidable predicate? Yes!

We need to write a function:

``` {.haskell}
isKnockable :: Sing s -> Decision (Knockable s)
```

I recommend taking a moment and trying to implement this yourself. Remember to
enable `-Wall` to make sure you're handling all potential pattern matching
cases.

Are you ready? Here's a solution:

``` {.haskell}
isKnockable :: Sing s -> Decision (Knockable s)
isKnockable = \case
    SOpened -> Disproved $ \case            -- s ~ 'Opened
    SClosed -> Proved KnockClosed           -- s ~ 'Closed
    SLocked -> Proved KnockLocked           -- s ~ 'Locked
```

This definition should seem pretty straightforward for the `SClosed` and
`SLocked` branches. `isKnockable SClosed :: Decision (Knockable 'Closed)`, we
give `Proved KnockClosed`, which gives us just that!

However, `isKnockable SOpened :: Decision (Knockable 'Opened)`. We can't use
`Proved :: a -> Decision a`, because no such value of type `Knockable 'Opened`
exists. So, we have to say that we *disprove* it: we have to prove to GHC that
no such type could possibly exist. We do this by providing a function of type
`Refuted (Knockable 'Opened)`, or type `Knockable 'Opened -> Void`.

We can write it like this:

``` {.haskell}
disproveOpened :: Knockable 'Opened -> Void
disproveOpened k = case k of {}             -- empty pattern match
```

And we're good to go!

How does this work?

Well, remember, we have to pattern match on the possible inputs. However, we
can't use any of the "legal" patterns:

``` {.haskell}
disproveOpened :: Knockable 'Opened -> Void
disproveOpened k = case k of
    KnockClosed -> ...    -- not a valid pattern, since it's `Knockable 'Closed`
    KnockLocked -> ...    -- not a valid pattern, since it's `Knockable 'Locked`
```

If you include either of those patterns, GHC will complain. So, there is no
valid pattern to match on... so `disproveOpened = \case {}` is enough to write
the function `Knockable 'Opened -> Void`.

We can use this decision function, finally, to handle an arbitrary `Door` whose
status we not know until runtime:

``` {.haskell}
knockSomeDoor
    :: SomeDoor     -- ^ status not known until you pattern match at runtime
    -> IO ()
knockSomeDoor (MkSomeDoor s d) = case isKnockable s of
    Proved k    -> knock k d
    Disproved _ -> putStrLn "No knocking allowed!"
```

#### Perspective on Proofs

We briefly touched on a very simple version of a dependently typed proof, and
how to "prove" properties.

If you have heard things about dependently typed programming before, you might
have heard that a lot of it involves "proving properties about your programs"
and "forcing you to provide proofs for all of your actions". The idea of a
"proof" might seem a bit scary and "mathematical" to those coming from a
software development world.

However, as we just saw, working with proofs and decisions of proofs can be as
simple as a couple lines of GADTs and dependent pattern matches:

``` {.haskell}
data Knockable :: DoorState -> Type where
    KnockClosed :: Knockable 'Closed
    KnockLocked :: Knockable 'Locked

isKnockable :: Sing s -> Decision (Knockable s)
isKnockable = \case
    SOpened -> Disproved $ \case
    SClosed -> Proved KnockClosed
    SLocked -> Proved KnockLocked
```

`Knockable` is our *predicate*, values of type `Knockable s` are our *proofs*
(or witnesses), and `isKnockable` is our *decision function*. So, when we see a
function like:

``` {.haskell}
knock :: Knockable s -> Door s -> IO ()
```

We can read the type signature as: "Knocking requires both a `Door s` and a
*proof* that the door's status is `Knockable`". It makes it impossible for us to
run `knock` on a status that is not `Knockable`, like, say, `'Opened`.

In this light, the role of a proof is like a "key" that a type (like `'Closed`)
must provide to "unlock" functions like `knock`.[^2] A *decision function* is a
function to generate these proofs (or prove that they are impossible) for given
types.

On one level, you can think of proofs as "compiler tricks", or things that exist
only to appease the compiler. In fact, Compilers of languages that encourage
heavy usage of proofs (like Agda, Coq, Idris) actually implement something
called *proof erasure*. That is, in those languages, values like `KnockClosed`
and `KnockLocked` might never exist at runtime, since they never actually *do*
anything at runtime. They only exist as ways to limit or enable specific
programs from compiling, and serve no purpose after compilation. GHC Haskell
does not implement proof erasure at the time of this post (current GHC version
8.6), but if proofs like this become commonplace, you might be reading this
during a time where GHC Haskell erases proofs like `Knockable` witnesses!

#### The Role of Singletons

Proofs themselves might not play a role at run-time, but generating/deciding
them with types requires being able to pattern match and work with *types* at
run-time. Because of this, singletons play an important practical role in
working with proofs in Haskell.

After all, remember the type of our decision function:

``` {.haskell}
isKnockable :: Sing a -> Decision (Knockable a)
```

The `Sing` allows `isKnockable` to pattern match and inspect the *type* `a` to
create your proof.

In this light, the *singletons* library provides many tools for working with
proofs and decisions. In fact, the entire *Data.Singletons.Decide* module is
dedicated to working with proofs and decisions. It provides the `Decision` data
type and `Refuted` type synonym, both featured above.

It also re-exports a particularly useful predicate from *base*, *propositional
equality*:

``` {.haskell}
data (:~:) :: k -> k -> Type where
    Refl :: a :~: a
```

Like how `Knockable` is a predicate that a given status is "knockable",
`'Blah :~:` is a predicate that a given type is *equal to* `'Blah`. A value of
type `Knockable s` is a proof that `s` is knockable, and a value of type
`'Blah :~: a` is a proof that `a` is *equal to* `'Blah`.

To see how, note the constructors that it allows. Remember that we limit
`Knockable s` to only having "knockable" `s` by only allowing two constructors,
so we can only construct valid values. The same thing happens here --
`'Blah :~:` only has *one single constructor*: `Refl :: 'Blah :~: 'Blah`. The
only valid constructor is one where the left hand side is equal to the right
hand side.

It also offers the "kindclass" `SDecide`, which provides *decision functions*
for the `a :~:` predicate:

``` {.haskell}
class SDecide k where
    (%~) :: Sing (a :: k)
         -> Sing (b :: k)
         -> Decision (a :~: b)
```

For example, `Bool` is an instance of `SDecide`, so we have a function:

``` {.haskell}
(STrue %~) :: Sing b -> Decision ('True :~: b)
```

which is a decision function to check if `b` is equal to `'True`. You can sort
of imagine `SDecide` as a type-level `Eq` typeclass, but for "type equality".

### Type Level Functions

We're now going to look at a different method useful for restricting how we can
call functions. Something we can do is define a type that expresses
knockable-or-not-knockable, as a value:[^3]

``` {.haskell}
$(singletons [d|
  data Pass = Obstruct | Allow
  |])
```

And we can write a *type-level function* (implemented as *type family*) from
`DoorState` to a `Pass`:

``` {.haskell}
type family StatePass (s :: DoorState) :: Pass where
    StatePass 'Opened = 'Obstruct
    StatePass 'Closed = 'Allow
    StatePass 'Locked = 'Allow
```

We've briefly touched on type families before (in talking about `SingKind`), but
as a quick review, type families act a bit like type-level functions. They take
types as input arguments and return types in return.

Like type synonyms, type families can't be partially applied. They only ever
make sense in "fully applied" form, with all arguments given syntactically.

We can inspect how type families are applied by using the `:kind!` command in
ghci:

``` {.haskell}
ghci> :kind! StatePass 'Opened
'Obstruct
ghci> :kind! StatePass 'Closed
'Allow
```

Armed with this type family, we can write a new version of `knock`:

``` {.haskell}
knock :: (StatePass s ~ 'Allow) => Door s -> IO ()
knock d = putStrLn $ "Knock knock on " ++ doorMaterial d ++ " door!"
```

`a ~ b` is a constraint for *type equality*. This constraint means that calling
`knock` requires that `StatePass s` being *equal* to `'Allow`. So, if attempt to
call `knock` with a `'Locked` door, `StatePass 'Locked` is `'Allow`, so the
constraint is satisfied and everyone is happy. If we attempt to call `knock`
with an `'Opened` door, `StatePass 'Opened` is `'Obstruct`, so the constraint is
not satisfied and everyone is sad.

``` {.haskell}
ghci> let door1 = UnsafeMkDoor @'Closed "Oak"
ghci> let door2 = UnsafeMkDoor @'Opened "Spruce"
ghci> knock door1
-- Knock knock on Oak door!
ghci> knock door2
COMPILE ERROR!
--     • Couldn't match type ‘'Allow’ with ‘'Obstruct’
--             arising from a use of ‘knock’
```

#### Deciding at Runtime

One nice thing is that, if we know `s` at compile-time, we can call this
function without having to pass any manual proofs. However, how can we run into
the same issue as before --- what happens if we don't know `s` until runtime?
How do we prove to the compiler that `Passable s` is `'Allow`?

Remember that type families take *types* as inputs, so we can't write:

``` {.haskell}
knockSomeDoor :: SomeDoor -> IO ()
knockSomeDoor (MkSomeDoor s d) = case StatePass s of
                                  -- ...
```

because `s`, a value, can't be given to `StatePass`.

What we really want to do is pass `s` (the singleton representing a type) to
`StatePass` (the type family). And then, we want to match on the *resulting
type*, so we can decide what to do based on the result.

If you think about this predicament long enough, you might begin to see a
solution. Essentially, we want a function that takes a *singleton* of `s`, and
return a *singleton* of `StatePass s`.

What we want, in the end, is a *mirror* of the type-level function *at the value
level*. We need to write a function of type `Sing s -> Sing (StatePass s)`:
given a singleton of a type, return a singleton of the type family applied to
the type.

``` {.haskell}
type family StatePass (s :: DoorState) :: Pass where
    StatePass 'Opened = 'Obstruct
    StatePass 'Closed = 'Allow
    StatePass 'Locked = 'Allow

sStatePass :: Sing s -> Sing (StatePass s)
sStatePass = \case
    SOpened -> SObstruct
    SClosed -> SAllow
    SLocked -> SAllow
```

We have to be very careful with how we define `sStatePass`, because GHC isn't
too smart. It'll reject any definition that isn't structurally identical to the
type family it's mirroring.

With our new tool, we can now write:

``` {.haskell}
knockSomeDoor
    :: SomeDoor     -- ^ status not known until you pattern match at runtime
    -> IO ()
knockSomeDoor (MkSomeDoor s d) = case sStatePass s of
    SAllow    -> knock d                         -- ^ `StatePass s ~ 'Allow`
    SObstruct -> putStrLn "No knocking allowed!" -- ^ `StatePass s ~ 'Obstruct`
```

First we use `sStatePass s` to check the "pass" of the `s`. Then, we match on
the `Pass`: if it's `Allow`, like the type signature of `knock` requires, we can
run `knock`. If not, then we cannot!

#### Singletons Library to the Rescue

At the high level, we defined a "function" on types (`StatePass`), using type
families.

And, just like we have to define singletons (`SOpened`, `SClosed`, etc.) at the
value level to mirror what is happening at the type level, we also have to
define *singleton functions* (`sStatePass`) at the value level to mirror what is
happening at the type level.

Defining singletons for our types is a tedious and mechanical process. Defining
singletonized functions for our type families is also similarly tedious and
mechanical. This is where the *singletons* library comes in: it provides us
Template Haskell tools to automatically define type families and their
associated singleton functions:

``` {.haskell}
$(singletons [d|
  data Pass = Obstruct | Allow

  statePass :: DoorState -> Pass
  statePass Opened = Allow
  statePass Closed = Obstruct
  statePass Locked = Obstruct
  |])
```

The above declaration would normally declare the following things:

1.  The *type* `Pass` with the data constructors `Obstruct :: Pass` and
    `Allow :: Pass`
2.  The *kind* `Pass` with the type constructors `'Obstruct :: Pass` and
    `'Allow :: Pass`.
3.  The value-level function `statePass` with the type `DoorSate -> Pass`.

However, with singleton's template haskell, this also generates:[^4]

1.  The *singleton family* for `Pass`, with data constructors
    `SObstruct :: Sing 'Obstruct` and `SAllow :: Sing 'Allow` (or, using the
    generated `SPass` type synonym, `SObstruct :: SPass 'Obstruct` and
    `SAllow :: SPass 'Allow`)
2.  The relevant `SingKind`, `SingI` instances, etc. for `Pass`'s singletons.
3.  The *type family* `StatePass (s :: DoorState) :: Pass`, like we defined
    above
4.  The *singleton function* `sStatePass :: Sing s -> Sing (StatePass s)`, like
    we defined above.

The naming convention for functions with non-symbol names takes a function like
`myFunction` and generates the type family `MyFunction` and the singleton
function `sMyFunction`.

The naming convention for functions with symbolic names (operators) takes an
operator like `++` and generates the type family `++` (keeping the identical
name) and the singleton function `%++`.[^5]

### A Comparison

We went over two methods of using phantom types with the singleton library and
dependent types to restrict how certain functions can be called, on a more
non-trivial level.

Our first method was using "dependently typed proofs". These are useful because
they are constructed to exploit the "structure" of the types you create.
Essentially, we create a data type (predicate) in a way so that it is impossible
to create an "invalid" proof. And, often, if we write our proofs in a clever
enough way, we can actually use and combine proofs to generate new proofs.

Personally, I find this to be the source of a lot of the "fun" of dependently
typed programming --- our proofs become first class values, and if we define
them in a nice enough way, we can use manipulate them to create new proofs. (A
full exploration of this is well beyond the scope of this post)

However, in practice, carefully constructing predicates and proofs (ones more
complicated than the one we just looked at) requires some up-front cost in
thinking about how to best express your predicate, and is sometimes not
straightforward.

I consider our second method, using type-level functions, to be the more
"mechanical" way, with less upfront cost in thinking time. For the most part, if
you can write a value-level function, you can write a type-level function. This
is even made simpler with singletons --- you can just write your value-level
relationship as a normal function, and you can now just directly use your
function at the type level.

In fact, consider if there were more than two "pass states" --- allow, obstruct,
or partial. In that case, we can restrict a function based on the pass state
being equal to any of the three or more. Using the dependently typed proof
version, we would have to create a new GADT for each one.

In a way, type-level functions deliver on the promise of blurring the line
between type and value. Our value-level functions are now type-level functions!
We just need to remember to switch our capitalizations! However, in Haskell,
they really fall short of a full dependently typed programming experience.

That's because in the end, who is going to prove your functions are "correct"?
Who is going to verify that you implemented your value-level and type-level
functions correctly? If you write normal value-level functions and promote them
using singletons, GHC doesn't necessarily do much to prevent any logic errors
you might have introduced.

In contrast, if you use dependently typed proofs correctly, these proofs can
*compose*, and GHC can check that *these proofs compose correctly*, or that the
compositions of your proofs are also valid proofs. That's because this is
enforced at the *structural level*. GHC can't do that directly with functions;
it can't check that the composition of functions gives correct answers.

These two approaches aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, and you often might
mix the two. (And, in fact, the constraint `StatePass s ~ 'Allow` could just be
replaced with asking for the proof of the predicate `StatePass s :~: 'Allow`).
It's good to understand the trade-offs in up-front cost, expressiveness, and
correctness! But, however way you play, the *singletons* library is here to make
our life easier.

Singleton Library Functions
---------------------------

As we have seen, working with type-level functions with singletons involves at
least two parts --- the type family working on the type-level values, and the
singleton functions mirroring the type family, working on the term-level
singletons.

The singletons library offers template haskell to make working with these things
pretty seamless. In fact, a good portion of Prelude and base is promoted and
exported by singletons!

You can find most of these in the *Data.Singletons.Prelude* module namespace.
So, with singletons, you get functions like:

``` {.haskell}
type family Fst (t :: (a, b)) :: a

sFst :: Sing t -> Sing (Fst t)
```

and

``` {.haskell}
type family IsLeft (t :: Either a b) :: Bool

sIsLeft :: Sing t -> Sing (IsLeft t)
```

and

``` {.haskell}
type family (xs :: [a]) ++ (ys :: [b]) :: [b]

(%++) :: Sing xs -> Sing ys -> Sing (xs ++ ys)
```

### Promoted Typeclasses

But, how can we promote functions like `(==)` and `max`, which are
typeclass-polymorphic?

With kindclasses (typeclasses for kinds), of course!

Let's remember what we need for these promoted functions to work: the type
families, and the singleton functions.

The *singletons* library handles this by providing each of these in a separate
typeclass. Let's look at the humble `Eq` typeclass as an example:

``` {.haskell}
class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

The *singletons* library would promote this (and you can do this using the same
template haskell splices we've been using this entire time, too) as:

``` {.haskell}
class PEq a where
    type (x :: a) == (y :: a) :: Bool
    type (x :: a) /= (y :: a) :: Bool

class SEq a where
    (%==) :: Sing (x :: a) -> Sing (y :: a) -> Sing (x == y)
    (%/=) :: Sing (x :: a) -> Sing (y :: a) -> Sing (x /= y)
```

The naming convention is to just add `P` for the "promoted" type family
functions, and `S` for the singleton functions.

#### Automatically Promoting Instances

The *singletons* library is smart enough to automatically promote instances, as
well, including derived ones!

``` {.haskell}
$(singletons [d|
  data Pass = Obstruct | Allow

  instance Eq Pass where
      Obstruct == Obstruct = True
      Obstruct == Allow    = False
      Allow    == Obstruct = False
      Allow    == Allow    = True

      Obstruct /= Obstruct = True
      Obstruct /= Allow    = False
      Allow    /= Obstruct = False
      Allow    /= Allow    = True
  |])
```

This automatically also generates `PEq` and `SEq` instances for `Pass`:

``` {.haskell}
ghci> :kind! 'Obstruct == 'Obstruct
'True
ghci> SAllow %== SObstruct
SFalse
```

But, you can also just write:

``` {.haskell}
$(singletons [d|
  data Pass = Obstruct | Allow
    deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
  |])
```

And this works as well!

``` {.haskell}
ghci> :kind! Show_ 'Obstruct      -- is named Show_ to not conflict with prelude Show
"Obstruct"
ghci> sMax SObstruct SAllow
SAllow
```

[^1]: All of this is ignoring the "bottom" value that is an occupant of every
    type in Haskell. We can use bottom to subvert pretty much all proofs in
    Haskell, unfortunately, so the discussion from this point forward assumes we
    are talking about a subset of haskell where all values are non-bottom and
    all functions are total.

[^2]: Sorry to mix up similar metaphors like this! Definitely not intentional :)

[^3]: Really, we could just use `Bool` instead of defining a `Pass` type. We're
    just going through a new type for the sake of example, and it can be useful
    because a type like `Pass` might potentially have even more constructors!

[^4]: In the spirit of full disclosure, the Template Haskell also generates some
    other things (known as *defunctionalization symbols*), which we will be
    talking about in the next part of this series.

[^5]: Note that this is a change since *singletons-2.4*. In previous versions,
    `++` would generate the type family `:++` and the singleton function `%:++`.
