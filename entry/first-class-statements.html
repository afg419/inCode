That is, (imperative) statements are literally just normal objects (no different from numbers, or lists, or booleans) --- they can be saved to variables, passed to functions, transformed using normal functions, copied, etc. Haskell doesn't have statements --- everything is an expression, representing normal data! This really opens up a whole world of possibilities for not only reasoning about your code, but also for new ways to frame ideas in contexts of parallelism, concurrency, exceptions, DSLs, and more.</p>
<p>To clarify, by &quot;statement&quot;, I mean it in the sense of a &quot;command&quot; from traditional imperative programming that, when control flow reaches it, executes some sort of action or modification to some state. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)">wikipedia article</a> has a nice explanation. Some typical statements from common imperative languages include:</p>
<p>~~~c int a = 4; // declaration &amp; assignment a += 5; // modification printf(&quot;hello world&quot;); // call return false; // exit points ~~~</p>
<p>In these languages, whenever control flow reaches these statements, something happens. We do not differentiate the act of <em>evaluating</em> these statements (figuring out what they are) from <em>executing</em> these statements. Something just <em>happens</em> when you see an assignment.</p>
<p>It is clear that in these languages, something about these statements are magical or a special part of the language. They are wholly different than, say, an integer, or a boolean. They aren't normal &quot;objects&quot; or &quot;data&quot; in your system.</p>
<p>Even if your programming languages have first-class functions, <code>printf</code> might be a first-class value, but the <em>call</em> of it (usually indicated with parentheses, like <code>printf()</code>) is definitely something...different altogether. You <em>can</em> simulate this in languages by creating a sub-language inside the language, but you're always going to have an interplay between the two. There will always be the dichotomy between statements and data.</p>
<h2>Statements as data</h2>
<p>In Haskell, <code>putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot;</code> is literally just a normal, boring object, of type <code>IO ()</code> (If you come from an OOP background, <code>IO a</code> is sort of like a generic/template, <code>IO &lt;a&gt;</code>). Like an <code>Int</code>, or <code>Bool</code>, or a <code>String</code>, or a <code>[Double]</code> (a list of <code>Double</code>). <em>Evaluating</em> it doesn't really do anything. It's like evaluating the number <code>1</code>, or the expression <code>2 + 5</code>. Cool --- you evaluated <code>2 + 5</code> into a <code>7</code>; now what? Does anything happen? Not really. It's still just an <code>Int</code>.</p>
<p><code>putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot;</code> is just a normal data/term/value that represents (through some abstract representation that isn't really important) the act of a <em>computer</em> printing the string <code>&quot;hello world&quot;</code> to stdout.</p>
<p>&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; <strong>Aside</strong></p>
<p>The type <code>IO ()</code> means &quot;an object/abstracted data structure that represents the act of a computer computing a <code>()</code>&quot; --- or, in other terms, &quot;instructions for a computer to produce a <code>()</code>&quot;. <code>()</code> is sort of like the empty tuple...it's a type that is only inhabited by just...well, <code>()</code>. You can think of <code>()</code> as being analogous to a function returning &quot;void&quot; in other languages.</p>
<p>If you have experience with object-oriented languages and templates/generics, <code>IO a</code> sort of corresponds to something like <code>IO&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>There are definitely many values of type <code>IO Int</code> or <code>IO String</code>, which represent actions that produce an <code>Int</code> or a <code>String</code>, respectively. One common example is <code>getLine</code>, which is of type <code>IO String</code> --- <code>getLine</code> is an object that represents the act of a computer getting input from stdin; the &quot;result&quot; of this action is a <code>String</code>. An <code>IO Int</code> would represent a CPU computation/IO-based computation that produces an <code>Int</code>.</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion, we'll only be considering <code>IO ()</code>s...but in real life, these other types pop up just as often. &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Haskell gives you a bunch of <em>combinators</em>/functions to <em>work</em> with these <code>IO ()</code>'s (and <code>IO a</code>'s in general). To manipulate then, merge them, sequence them, compose them...anything you can dream of!</p>
<p>The most popular and common combinator is <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code>, which is usually used as an infix operator. A common use case: Say you want to create an IO action that prints &quot;hello&quot;, then &quot;world&quot;. But you only have <code>putStrLn &quot;hello&quot;</code>, which represents printing &quot;hello&quot;, and <code>putStrLn &quot;world&quot;</code>, which represents printing &quot;world&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have those two <code>IO ()</code>s, you can use the <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> combinator to &quot;merge&quot; them and create a new <code>IO ()</code>.[^fftype] In this case:</p>
<p>~~~haskell -- :: means &quot;has the type&quot;</p>
<p>-- putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; is an object with type IO (). putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; :: IO () putStrLn &quot;world&quot; :: IO ()</p>
<p>(&gt;&gt;) :: IO () -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>The type signature of <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> says (in simple terms) that it's a function that takes two <code>IO ()</code>s and returns a shiny new <code>IO ()</code>. It's a function that takes two objects and returns one.</p>
<p>We can apply <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> as an infix operator:</p>
<p>~~~haskell helloThenWorld :: IO () helloThenWorld = putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; &gt;&gt; putStrLn &quot;world&quot;</p>
<p>-- define <code>helloThenWorld</code> as putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; &gt;&gt; putStrLn &quot;world&quot;; and its type is <code>IO ()</code>. ~~~</p>
<p>That new <code>IO ()</code> is a data structure that represents the act of printing &quot;hello&quot;, then printing &quot;world&quot;.</p>
<p>Remember that this new one is, still, only a normal object. No printing actually ever &quot;happens&quot; if you evaluate <code>putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; &gt;&gt; putStrLn &quot;world&quot;</code>. If you ever reach that expression in a Haskell program...nothing is printed. It's simply just taking two regular old data values, running them through a function, and giving you a third one. The process of defining <code>helloThenWorld</code> --- or even later evaluating it --- doesn't cause anything to happen. They are inert data structures.</p>
<p>In many other languages, sequencing actions is a special part of the syntax --- a semicolon, usually. In Haskell, sequencing is not special --- it's just a normal function on normal data structures.</p>
<p>You can even make your own &quot;first class&quot; control flow!</p>
<p>~~~haskell when :: Bool -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () when True p = p when False _ = return () ~~~</p>
<p>(<code>return ()</code> is an <code>IO ()</code> that represents the act of doing nothing...it doesn't actually have anything to do with the <code>return</code> keyword in many other languages. It basically represents a no-op.)</p>
<p><code>when</code> is just a normal function! It takes a <code>Bool</code> and an <code>IO ()</code>; if the <code>Bool</code> is true, then the &quot;result&quot; is just that same <code>IO ()</code>.</p>
<p>We can evaluate a call to <code>when (4 &gt; 0) (putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot;)</code> by hand:</p>
<p>~~~haskell when (4 &gt; 0) (putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot;) :: IO () when True (putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot;) :: IO () -- evaluate 4 &gt; 0 putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot; :: IO () -- definition of when True</p>
<p>when (4 &lt; 0) (putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot;) :: IO () when False (putStrLn &quot;it's True!&quot;) :: IO () -- evaluate 4 &lt; 0 return () :: IO () -- definition of when False ~~~</p>
<p>The above is <em>not</em> an &quot;execution&quot;...it's an <em>evaluation</em>. Execution involves executing actions on a computer, where evaluation is simply a reduction, like <code>1 + 1 ==&gt; 2</code>. <code>when</code> is a function that takes a <code>Bool</code> and an <code>IO ()</code> object and <em>evaluates</em> to that <code>IO ()</code> object when the boolean is True. But remember, calling <code>when</code> doesn't actually execute anything! It's just a normal function and normal expression. An <code>IO ()</code> goes in, and <code>IO ()</code> comes out. Just a normal function on normal data. And we know it's just a normal function, because we wrote it ourself from scratch!</p>
<p>You can't write <code>when</code> in this naive way in a language like, say, Javascript:</p>
<p>~~~javascript var when = function(cond, act) { if (cond) { act; } };</p>
<p>when(false, console.log(&quot;hello&quot;)); // &quot;hello&quot; is printed, even though the condition is false ~~~</p>
<p>(You can simulate something that works by having <code>when</code> take functions instead of statements...but that's the point! You can't pass in a &quot;statement&quot;, you have to pass in a function/data. In this sense, statements and data behave completely differently.)</p>
<p>With only a basic knowledge of functional programming (using a fold/reduce/inject, basically, or even recursion), you can easy write this function:</p>
<p>~~~haskell sequence_ :: [IO ()] -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>Which says, &quot;give me a list of <code>IO ()</code>s, and I'll give you a new <code>IO ()</code> that represents executing all of those <code>IO ()</code>s one-after-another&quot;.</p>
<p>&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; <strong>Aside</strong></p>
<p>If you are curious, here is the definition of <code>sequence</code> using a fold:</p>
<p>~~~haskell sequence_ :: [IO ()] -&gt; IO () sequence_ xs = foldr (&gt;&gt;) (return ()) xs ~~~</p>
<p>If you're familiar with folds/reduces, <code>return ()</code> is the &quot;base value&quot;, and <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> is the &quot;accumulating function&quot;.</p>
<p>~~~haskell sequence_ [putStrLn &quot;hello&quot;, putStrLn &quot;world&quot;, putStrLn &quot;goodbye!&quot;]</p>
<p>-- evaluates to: putStrLn &quot;hello&quot; &gt;&gt; (putStrLn &quot;world&quot; &gt;&gt; (putStrLn &quot;goodbye!&quot; &gt;&gt; return ())) ~~~ &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>Note that all of these functions take anything of type <code>IO ()</code>...so I could really be passing in named <code>IO ()</code>'s, or the result of combinators, or...</p>
<p>~~~haskell hello :: IO () hello = putStrLn &quot;hello&quot;</p>
<p>world :: IO () world = putStrLn &quot;world&quot;</p>
<p>helloworld :: IO () helloworld = hello &gt;&gt; world</p>
<p>helloworldhelloworld :: IO () helloworldhelloworld = sequence_ [hello, world, helloworld] ~~~</p>
<p>Remember -- nothing is being called or executed. It's just all normal functions on normal data. The inputs are data, the outputs are data.</p>
<p>But wait! There are a lot of things I can do with two <code>IO ()</code>s besides executing them one-after-the-other. I can...merge them <em>in parallel</em>!</p>
<p>I can write a combinator:</p>
<p>~~~haskell bothPar :: IO () -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>That takes two <code>IO ()</code>s and create a new shiny <code>IO ()</code> that represents the act of executing them <em>in parallel</em>.</p>
<p>Then I can also write a new <code>sequencePar</code>:</p>
<p>~~~haskell sequencePar :: [IO ()] -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>That takes a list of <code>IO ()</code>s and returns a new shiny <code>IO ()</code> that represents the act of executing them all <em>in parallel</em>!</p>
<p>This is one great thing about IO-as-data: If you have a bunch of IO actions, you have the <em>choice</em> in how you want to &quot;sequence&quot; or &quot;combine&quot; them. In Haskell, combining a bunch of actions in sequence and combining them in parallel is just a matter of swapping out your combining function! There is <em>no difference</em> at the syntax level!</p>
<p>Compare this to other languages, where the syntax for sequencing statements --- the semicolon --- and the syntax required for launching a bunch of parallel actions is noticeably different. In Haskell, &quot;sequencing&quot; isn't a part of the syntax (the semicolon) --- it's just <em>a regular ol' function</em>!</p>
<p>&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; <strong>Aside</strong></p>
<p><code>sequencePar</code>'s implementation is pretty much identical to <code>sequence</code>'s, but swapping out <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> for <code>bothPar</code>:</p>
<p>~~~haskell sequencePar :: [IO ()] -&gt; IO () sequencePar xs = foldr bothPar (return ()) xs ~~~</p>
<p>By the way, <code>bothPar</code> isn't defined by default, but we'll define it really soon. &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>There are an entire wealth of combinators by which to compose and sequence and manipulate <code>IO ()</code>s together. And many of them you can even write yourself, from scratch.</p>
<p>There are also many &quot;IO action transformers&quot; you have access to --- one notable one being <code>makePar</code>:[^fio]</p>
<p>~~~haskell makePar :: IO () -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>That takes an <code>IO ()</code>, and &quot;transforms&quot; it into a &quot;parallel&quot; <code>IO ()</code>. Or rather, it takes an object representing a computer action, and returns an object representing launching that computer action in a parallel fork.</p>
<p>We can write <code>bothPar</code> ourselves, then, with this:[^parsimp]</p>
<p>~~~haskell bothPar :: IO () -&gt; IO () -&gt; IO () bothPar x y = makePar x &gt;&gt; makePar y ~~~</p>
<p>Give <code>bothPar</code> two <code>IO ()</code>'s representing computer actions, and it'll give you a new one that represents launching both computer actions in parallel. To do that, simply launch them both one after the other!</p>
<p>Another common transformer on an <code>IO ()</code> is <code>catch</code>:[^catch]</p>
<p>~~~haskell catch :: IO () -&gt; (SomeException -&gt; IO ()) -&gt; IO () -- ^ ^ ^ -- | | +-- modified object -- | +-- handler function -- +-- original object ~~~</p>
<p>Which takes an <code>IO ()</code> object and a handler function, and imbues that <code>IO ()</code> with &quot;error handling capabilities&quot;. It returns a new <code>IO ()</code> object that represents doing the same thing as the original one, except with built-in error handling if things go wrong. Neat!</p>
<p>So if I used <code>catch (putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot;) myHandler</code>...I'm &quot;transforming&quot; the <code>IO ()</code> (<code>putStrLn &quot;hello world&quot;</code>), representing printing a string to the console, into a new <code>IO ()</code> which represents printing a string to the console, with built in error handling if things go wrong for some reason.</p>
<p>Again --- no execution is being done. We're simply taking an object representing an IO action, and returning a new, modified one representing a slightly different IO action.</p>
<p>&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; <strong>Aside</strong></p>
<p>This is a pretty aside-y aside, and you can definitely skip it if you want!</p>
<p>One particularly important combinator I have not mentioned yet is called &quot;bind&quot;: <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code></p>
<p>Let's say you wanted to read a line from stdin, and then print it out right away. You can do this with <code>getLine :: IO String</code> and <code>putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()</code>. But wait! This doesn't work:</p>
<p>~~~haskell getLine &gt;&gt; putStrLn &quot;hello?&quot; ~~~</p>
<p><code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> acts like a semicolon...it just sequences them together one after the other. Wouldn't it be nice if we had something like a unix pipe? It &quot;sequences&quot; the two things, but the result of the first can be used by the second?</p>
<p>Well, if <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> is a bash semicolon <code>;</code>, then <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> is a bash pipe <code>|</code>!</p>
<p>~~~haskell getLine &gt;&gt;= putStrLn :: IO () ~~~</p>
<p>does exactly what we want!</p>
<p>The type of <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> is:</p>
<p>~~~haskell (&gt;&gt;=) :: IO a -&gt; (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; IO b ~~~</p>
<p>And in our specific case, it is:</p>
<p>~~~haskell (&gt;&gt;=) :: IO String -&gt; (String -&gt; IO ()) -&gt; IO () ~~~</p>
<p>Which says, &quot;give me an <code>IO String</code> and a function taking a <code>String</code> and producing an <code>IO ()</code>, and I'll give you a shiny new <code>IO ()</code>&quot; This might sound a little weird at first, but see how <code>getLine :: IO String</code> and <code>putStrLn :: String -&gt; IO ()</code> fit into this, and see how it basically works like a unix pipe in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> is actually a lot more powerful than it might seem at first. As soon as you add the <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> combinator to your arsenal...the space of programs you can construct using various <code>IO a</code>'s opens up in crazy ways. Just imagine bash with no pipes, and only semicolons! If you ever decide to implement some system of first-class statements, and it might be tricky to state/model imperative computations without <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code>. &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<h3>Much More</h3>
<p>This is only a small subset of what you can do with &quot;statements as data&quot;. In fact, there are many frameworks that completely abstract over statements entirely. For example, you can &quot;construct&quot; a system declaratively using a simple DSL, and never even worry about statements or IO. You can specify an <em>entire program</em>, with a full description of its interactions, without ever even <em>touching</em> the IO type. The DSL might provide you with a way to specify a high-level overlook of your program in simple terms. The DSL might be abstracting/wrapping over <em>complex</em> IO actions, and all you ever see is the simple API.</p>
<p>And then, you might have a function: <code>DSL -&gt; IO ()</code>. Construct the elaborate high-level thing in simple terms...and then, at the end, <em>convert it to an <code>IO ()</code> object</em>. That you can copy, or clone, or throw into a function, or do <em>anything</em> we just mentioned here!</p>
<p>If that DSL is your entire program, then you also have certain guarantees about what IO your program can even do, if the DSL library forbids users from mixing in arbitrary IO.</p>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>That's nice and all. We see how having first class statements as data is useful for manipulation and abstractions and stuff. But it all seems kind of useless if our data structures remain inert and don't actually do anything.</p>
<p>Luckily, one can think of a Haskell compiler as a giant function: <code>IO () -&gt; Binary</code>. Give the Haskell compiler an <code>IO ()</code>, and it'll convert it to a &quot;binary&quot; for a given architecture/computer/CPU. It &quot;translates&quot; the <em>representation of a computation</em> into concrete bytecode that a computer can actually execute.</p>
<p>Your computer can then execute that generated binary, and...off we go!</p>
<p>Every Haskell program by convention compiles <em>one single <code>IO ()</code></em>. That is, you might have a <em>bunch</em> of <code>IO a</code>s in your program, but you &quot;offer the compiler&quot; <em>one</em> <code>IO ()</code> for it to compile, and it compiles it for you. So if you have a lot of different IO computations you wish to do, you basically continually sequence, merge, pipe, combine, transform, etc. them until you get one final <code>IO ()</code> which represents your entire desired computation. And then you name it &quot;main&quot;. When your compiler compiles the Haskell file, it'll find the <code>IO ()</code> named &quot;main&quot;, and compile that one.</p>
<p>In a way, one can think of Haskell as a very elaborate metaprogramming system, providing a DSL to &quot;generate&quot; byte code.</p>
<p>By the way, did you see how <code>IO ()</code> is <em>completely separate</em> from its binary representation? Hm. Why do we have to compile it to binary, anyway?</p>
<p>Enter in <em>other Haskell compilers</em>, like [ghcjs] --- instead of being <code>IO () -&gt; Binary</code>, it's <code>IO () -&gt; Javascript</code>! That is, give it <em>any</em> ol' <code>IO ()</code> (the same one that you would design for a CPU/processor), and instead of translating it into bytecode/binary, it translates it into Javascript! This is another power of having <code>IO ()</code> being its own, abstract object that is independent of the architecture or computer that it will be eventually run on. Because it's so abstract...it can be compiled and run really on <em>anything</em>!</p>

<p>In this post I've suggested that <code>IO ()</code> is some sort of data structure that stores the &quot;action&quot; it represents in some abstract way. If you're curious on what this representation/storage might look like in concrete terms, <a href="http://chris-taylor.github.io/blog/2013/02/09/io-is-not-a-side-effect/">Chris Taylor has a post</a> on what you might see if you &quot;peek into&quot; the internal representation of (a possible implementation of) an IO action type --- you could even use this to implement first-class statements in your language of choice! [^ghc]</p>
<p>This post is a distillation of concepts I have mentioned in <a href="http://blog.jle.im/entry/the-compromiseless-reconciliation-of-i-o-and-purity">some other</a> <a href="http://blog.jle.im/entry/inside-my-world-ode-to-functor-and-monad">blog posts</a> in the past; I've had a lot of new thoughts after writing both of them and I figured I'd condense them and make a new post summarizing the new ideas in a new and more concise way, to have them all in one neat place. Anyways, if you want to go into this topic in more detail, those posts above might help!</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning Haskell, try picking up <a href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell</a> and giving it a read, it's pretty accessible! <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell">bitemyapp's guide</a> also lays out a nice roadmap for learning Haskell.</p>
<p>Also, I encourage you to try to implement your own system of &quot;first class IO&quot; in languages in which it is possible! Like a normal data structure (like in the Chris Taylor post), or an abstracted function call. I'd love to hear of any results or attempts you've made implementing this in your language of choice (even if Haskell is your language of choice, you can write a <code>MyIO</code> type :D ); let me know in the comments or via <a href="https://twitter.com/mstk" title="Twitter">twitter</a>!</p>
